Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone \\
So smart, she's leading me to ozone \\
Music the great communicator \\
Use two sticks to make it in the nature \\
\\
I'll get you into penetration \\
The gender of a generation \\
The birth of every other nation \\
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation \\
\\
This chapter's going to be a close one \\
Smoke rings, I know you're going to blow one \\
All on a spaceship, persevering \\
Use my hands for everything but steering \\
\\
Can't stop the spirits when they need you \\
Mop tops are happy when they feed you \\
J. Butterfly is in the treetop \\
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop \\
