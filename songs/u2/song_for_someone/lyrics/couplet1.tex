You got a face not spoiled by beauty \\
I have some scars from where I've been \\
You've got eyes that can see right through me \\
You're not afraid of anything they've seen \\
\\
I was told that I would feel nothing the first time \\
I don't know how these cuts heal, but in you I found a rhyme. \\
