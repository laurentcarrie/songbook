He said "Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet you" \\
I just met this 5 foot 7 guy who's just my type \\
I like the way he's speaking, his confidence is peaking \\
Don't like his baggy jeans \\
But I'mma like what's underneath them \\
\\
And no I ain't been to M.I.A \\
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's heart awaits \\
First let's see the west end, I'll show you to my brethren \\
I'm liking this American boy, American boy \\
