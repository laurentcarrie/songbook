Since you've gone I've been lost \songwordfb{~} without a \songwordfb{trace} \\
I dream at night, I can \songwordfb{only} see your face \songwordfb{~}  \\
I look around but it's \songwordfb{you} I can't replace \songwordfb{~} \\
I feel so cold and I \songwordfb{long} for your embrace \songwordfb{~}  \\
I keep cryin', "\songwordfb{Baby}, baby, bplease" \\
