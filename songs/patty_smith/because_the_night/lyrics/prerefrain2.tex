\\
Come on now, try and understand  \\
The way I feel under your command.  \\
Take my hand as the sun descends.  \\
They can't touch you now, can't touch you now, can't touch you now.  \\

Because the night belongs to lovers.  \\
Because the night belongs to lust.  \\
Because the night belongs to lovers.  \\
Because the night belongs to us.  \\
With love we sleep; with doubt the viscious circle turn and turns.  \\
Without you I cannot live, forgive the yearning, burning  \\
I believe in time, too real to feel,  \\
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now.      \\
Because the night belongs to lovers.  \\
Because the night belongs to lust.  \\
Because the night belongs to lovers.  \\
Because the night belongs to us.  \\
