Upstairs in bed, with my ex boy \\
He's in a place, but I can't get joy \\
Thinking on you in the final throes \\
This is when my buzzer goes \\
Run out to meet you, chips and pitta \\
\\
You say when we married \\
'cause you're not bitter \\
"There'll be none of him no more \\
I cried for you on the kitchen floor \\
